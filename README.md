## Install dependencies
To run the project on the web, we need to install the following dependencies that will help to run the project on the web:

```
expo install react-dom react-native-web @expo/metro-runtime
```
## Run the app on mobile and web
In the project directory, run the following command to start a development server from the terminal:

```
expo start 
```

Once the development server is running, the easiest way to launch the app is on a physical device with Expo Go. For more information, see Open app on a device.
To see the web app in action, press w in the terminal. It will open the web app in the default web browser.
